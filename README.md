Manly Mustache Contest - 2013 Edition
=====================================

What is it?
-----------

This is the source code used to run the [Manly Mustache Contest](http://mustache.chryso.net) (2013 Edition).

The contest is meant to correspond to No-shave November and [Movember](http://us.movember.com) as a way to raise awareness for men's health issues.

The contest begins on November 1st, where each participating gentleman must be clean shaven (with photographic evidence).

It is a work-in-progress, but takes care of the basics of participation such as voting and image submission.
